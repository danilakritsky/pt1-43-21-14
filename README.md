============

A simple note-taking app.

Dedicated to class **pt1-43-21** :)

This is the final project for the **it-academy**'s [Web Development with Python](https://www.it-academy.by/course/python-developer/pt-python-developer/) course.

The app's is inspired by the following tutorials and borrows heavily from them:
- [Developing and Testing an Asynchronous API with FastAPI and Pytest](https://testdriven.io/blog/fastapi-crud/) - App's structure and tests configuration
- [Building a CRUD App with FastAPI and MongoDB](https://testdriven.io/blog/fastapi-mongo/) - Asynchronous CRUD operations against a MongoDB database
- [Getting Started with MongoDB and FastAPI](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/quickstart/python-quickstart-fastapi/) - Pydantic models and response/request validation

Other links that assisted a lot during the development:
- [Docker for Python Developers](https://mherman.org/presentations/dockercon-2018/#1) - has been extremely helpful in configuring the docker environment for the app
- [Docker guide](https://robertcooper.me/post/docker-guide) - great docker overview
